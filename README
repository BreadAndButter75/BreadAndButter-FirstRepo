My name is Bryce, I go by Bread and Butter as an alias online. 

This Repo will be mostly filled with Powershell items that I have been working on pertaining to Active Directory, perhaps some Entra ID stuff.
I just wanted to create this as a starting point for some of my scripts. Before copying them over to an area where I no longer own them. 

These scripts will be free for anyone who finds to use. I won't be promoting them, I also won't be supporting them in anyway, they will be untested in production.
Outside of that I encourage you to use them for inspiration.
